Melville explains that he believes that Berlea has a compulsion to own beautiful things. Before he \"died\", he tried to buy three such objects, but was turned down. Now two of them have been stolen. Melville predicts that the third, the Starburst Diamond, will be purloined on Saturday at 11 pm. Bane has faith in him and keeps his staff after hours and notifies the authorities, who set up a stakeout at the bank where the jewel is stored. When the deadline passes without anything happening, Bane fires Melville. Melville agrees to go to Gregory\\'s retreat for a rest. Gregory\\'s men have dug a tunnel between the theater where the play, set on the front lines of World War I, will be performed and the bank. At the premiere, when mock explosions and firing are set off in a battle scene, they blast their way into the vault. When Peyton discovers the theft, she fears for Melville\\'s life. However, Melville has been one step ahead of his nemesis, and later that night captures Gregory/Berlea. Furious at being fooled, she makes her own prediction: \"to make him suffer for the rest of his life\" ... by marrying him.'},\n",

The Masher makes his attempt first. While he is talking to the Landlady played by Helen Carruthers the Rival pokes him with a fork from behind a curtain. The Masher gets upset and returns to the table. The Rival makes a gesture to the Masher and goes on to talk to the landlady. As the Masher sweet talks the Landlady, the Rival does the same thing the Masher did to him. The Landlady gets upset and walks away from the Masher. Upset, the Masher returns to the table and takes the Rival outside by his tie.[1] They eventually go their separate ways when the Masher goes into a bar and the Rival keeps walking toward the park. Before the Masher goes into the bar, he is distracted by a blonde girl (Cecile Arnold) who blinks at him. The girl turns and the Masher fallows her until her tall boyfriend appears. The Masher runs away.[1] Once at the park the Masher finds the Rival with a Brunette girl (Vivian Edwards). The girl the Masher had encountered before ends up at the park as well with her boyfriend. The Masher becomes jealous. He follows the two girls to a theater where he sits between them. He finally has the attention of both girls and zones off. The boyfriend and the Rival come into the theater to find the Masher with their respected girlfriends. The girls see their boyfriends and run out of the theater. The Masher is in his own world and did not realized the girls had been replaced by the tall boyfriend and the Rival. He opens his eyes and realizes what is happening.'}]"
